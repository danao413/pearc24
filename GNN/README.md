The matdeeplearn file contains the code that is needed to run the models in this work
The main process should be able to run with "python main.py --config_path <config_file> --data_path <data>"
please see: https://github.com/danao413/MatDeepLearn/tree/main for more information on how to run different processes
Each model has their own folder with the config file used to run the model as well as the three trained models used in the paper
We also provide the data and the targets under the Data folder
The environment.yml contains the conda environment needed to run
